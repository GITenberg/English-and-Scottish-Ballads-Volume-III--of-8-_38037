<h3><a name="EARL_RICHARD_Scott" id="EARL_RICHARD_Scott"></a>EARL RICHARD.</h3>


<p>A fragment of this gloomy and impressive romance,
(corresponding to v. 21-42,) was published in
Herd's <i>Scottish Songs</i>, i. 184, from which, probably, it
was copied into Pinkerton's <i>Scottish Tragic Ballads</i>,
p. 84. The entire ballad was first printed in <i>The Border
Minstrelsy</i>, together with another piece, <i>Lord
William</i>, containing a part of the same incidents. Of
the five versions which have appeared, four are given
in this place, and <a href="#EARL_RICHARD_B_See_p_260">the remaining one in the Appendix</a>.
In the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, 1794, Vol. 64, Part I.
p. 553, there is a modern ballad of extremely perverted
orthography and vicious style, (meant for
ancient,) in which the twenty lines of Herd's fragment
are interwoven with an altogether different
story. It is printed as authentic in <i>Scarce "Ancient"
Ballads</i>, Aberdeen, 1822.</p>

<p>"There are two ballads in Mr. Herd's MSS. upon
the following story, in one of which the unfortunate

<i>Clyde</i>, in Celtic, means <i>white</i>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lockhart.</span></p>

<p><a name="Linenote_III_11a_86" id="Linenote_III_11a_86"></a><a href="#LNanchor_III_11a_86" title="link to line number">86</a>. These are unquestionably the corpse-lights, called in
Wales <i>Canhwyllan Cyrph</i>, which are sometimes seen to illuminate
the spot where a dead body is concealed. The Editor
is informed, that, some years ago, the corpse of a man, drowned
in the Ettrick, below Selkirk, was discovered by means of
these candles. Such lights are common in churchyards, and
are probably of a phosphoric nature. But rustic superstition
derives them from supernatural agency, and supposes, that,
as soon as life has departed, a pale flame appears at the window
of the house, in which the person had died, and glides
towards the churchyard, tracing through every winding the
route of the future funeral, and pausing where the bier is to
rest. This and other opinions, relating to the "tomb-fires'
livid gleam," seem to be of Runic extraction. <span class="smcap">Scott.</span></p>

<p><a name="Linenote_III_11a_87" id="Linenote_III_11a_87"></a><a href="#LNanchor_III_11a_87" title="link to line number">87</a>. The deep holes, scooped in the rock by the eddies of a
river, are called <i>pots</i>; the motion of the water having there
some resemblance to a boiling caldron. <i>Linn</i>, means the
pool beneath a cataract. <span class="smcap">Scott.</span></p>

<p><a name="Linenote_III_11a_120" id="Linenote_III_11a_120"></a><a href="#LNanchor_III_11a_120" title="link to line number">120</a>. The lines immediately preceding, "The maiden
touched," &amp;c., and which are restored from tradition, refer
to a superstition formerly received in most parts of Europe,
and even resorted to by judicial authority, for the discovery
of murder. In Germany, this experiment was called <i>bahrrecht</i>,
or the law of the bier; because, the murdered body
being stretched upon a bier, the suspected person was obliged
to put one hand upon the wound and the other upon the
mouth of the deceased, and, in that posture, call upon heaven
to attest his innocence. If, during this ceremony, the blood
gushed from the mouth, nose, or wound, a circumstance not
unlikely to happen in the course of shifting or stirring the
body, it was held sufficient evidence of the guilt of the party.

<p>This ballad was communicated to Sir Walter Scott
by Mr. James Hogg, accompanied with the following
note:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am fully convinced of the antiquity of this song;
for, although much of the language seems somewhat
modernized, this must be attributed to its currency,
being much liked, and very much sung in this neighbourhood.
I can trace it back several generations, but
cannot hear of its ever having been in print. I have
never heard it with any considerable variation, save
that one reciter called the dwelling of the feigned
sweet-heart, <i>Castleswa</i>."</p>

very interesting and pathetic composition.</p>

<p>"Kercock and Balathy are two small villages on the
banks of the Tay; the latter is nearly opposite Stobhall.
According to tradition, the ill-fated hero of the ballad
had a leman in each of these places; and it was on
the occasion of his paying a visit to his Kercock love,
that the jealous dame in Balathy Toun, from a revengeful
feeling, scuttled the boat in which he was to recross
the Tay to Stobhall." <span class="smcap">Motherwell.</span></p>

<p class="center">First published in <i>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</i>, iii. 220.</p>


<p>"This ballad has been popular in many parts of
Scotland. It is chiefly given from Mrs. Brown of
Falkland's MSS. The expression,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
"The boy stared wild like a gray goss-hawk," <i>v.</i> 31,<br />
</p></div>

<p>strongly resembles that in <i>Hardyknute</i>,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
"Norse e'en like gray goss-hawk stared wild;"<br />
</p></div>

<p>a circumstance which led the Editor to make the
strictest inquiry into the authenticity of the song. But
every doubt was removed by the evidence of a lady
of high rank, who not only recollected the ballad, as
having amused her infancy, but could repeat many of
the verses, particularly those beautiful stanzas from the
20th to the 25th. The Editor is, therefore, compelled
to believe, that the author of <i>Hardyknute</i> copied the
old ballad, if the coincidence be not altogether accidental." <span class="smcap">Scott.</span></p>

<h3><a name="BONNIE_ANNIE" id="BONNIE_ANNIE"></a>BONNIE ANNIE.</h3>

<p class="center">From Kinloch's <i>Ancient Scottish Ballads</i>, p. 123.</p>


<p>"There is a prevalent belief among seafaring people,
that if a person who has committed any heinous crime
be on ship-board, the vessel, as if conscious of its guilty
burden, becomes unmanageable, and will not sail till
the offender be removed: to discover whom, they
usually resort to the trial of those on board, by casting
lots; and the individual upon whom the lot falls, is
declared the criminal, it being believed that Divine
Providence interposes in this manner to point out the
guilty person."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Kinloch.</span></p>

<p>Motherwell is inclined to think this an Irish ballad,
though popular in Scotland.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_DOWIE_DENS_OF_YARROW" id="THE_DOWIE_DENS_OF_YARROW"></a>THE DOWIE DENS OF YARROW.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</i>, iii. 143.</p>


<p>"This ballad, which is a very great favourite among
the inhabitants of Ettrick Forest, is universally believed
to be founded in fact. I found it easy to collect a variety
of copies; but very difficult indeed to select from
them such a collated edition as might, in any degree,
suit the taste of 'these more light and giddy-paced
times.'</p>

<p>"Tradition places the event, recorded in the song,
very early; and it is probable that the ballad was composed
soon afterwards, although the language has been
gradually modernized, in the course of its transmission
to us, through the inaccurate channel of oral tradition.
The bard does not relate particulars, but barely the
striking outlines of a fact, apparently so well known
when he wrote, as to render minute detail as unnecessary
as it is always tedious and unpoetical.</p>

<p>"The hero of the ballad was a knight of great
bravery, called Scott, who is said to have resided at
Kirkhope, or Oakwood Castle, and is, in tradition,
termed the Baron of Oakwood. The estate of Kirkhope
belonged anciently to the Scotts of Harden:<!-- Page 64 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
Oakwood is still their property, and has been so from
time immemorial. The Editor was, therefore, led to
suppose that the hero of the ballad might have been
identified with John Scott, sixth son of the Laird of
Harden, murdered in Ettrick Forest by his kinsmen,
the Scotts of Gilmanscleugh. (See notes to <i>Jamie
Telfer</i>.) This appeared the more probable, as the common
people always affirm that this young man was
treacherously slain, and that, in evidence thereof, his
body remained uncorrupted for many years; so that
even the roses on his shoes seemed as fresh as when he
was first laid in the family vault at Hassendean. But
from a passage in Nisbet's Heraldry, he now believes
the ballad refers to a duel fought at Deucharswyre, of
which Annan's Treat is a part, betwixt John Scott of
Tushielaw and his brother-in-law, Walter Scott, third
son of Robert of Thirlestane, in which the latter was
slain.</p>

<p>"In ploughing Annan's Treat, a huge monumental
stone, with an inscription, was discovered; but being
rather scratched than engraved, and the lines being
run through each other, it is only possible to read one
or two Latin words. It probably records the event of
the combat. The person slain was the male ancestor
of the present Lord Napier.</p>

<p>"Tradition affirms, that the hero of the song (be
he who he may) was murdered by the brother, either
of his wife or betrothed bride. The alleged cause of
malice was the lady's father having proposed to endow
her with half of his property, upon her marriage with
a warrior of such renown. The name of the murderer
is said to have been Annan, and the place of combat is
still called Annan's Treat. It is a low muir, on the<!-- Page 65 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
banks of the Yarrow, lying to the west of Yarrow Kirk.
Two tall unhewn masses of stone are erected, about
eighty yards distant from each other; and the least
child, that can herd a cow, will tell the passenger, that
there lie 'the two lords, who were slain in single
combat.'</p>

<p>"It will be, with many readers, the greatest recommendation
of these verses, that they are supposed to
have suggested to Mr. Hamilton of Bangour, the modern
ballad, beginning,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
'Busk ye, busk ye, my bonny bonny bride.'<br />
</p></div>

<p>"A fragment, apparently regarding the story of the
following ballad, but in a different measure, occurs in
Mr. Herd's MS., and runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'When I look east, my heart is sair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when I look west, it's mair and mair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For then I see the braes o' Yarrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there, for aye, I lost my marrow.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We have added an uncollated copy from Buchan's
<i>Ballads of the North of Scotland</i>. Another is furnished
by Motherwell, <i>Minstrelsy</i>, p. 252. Some of Scott's
verses are also found in Herd's fragment, (<i>Scottish
Songs</i>, i. 202,) and Buchan's <i>Haughs o' Yarrow</i>, ii. 211.
<i>The Dowy Den</i>, in Evans's collection, iii. 342, is the
<i>caput mortuum</i> of this spirited ballad.</p>

<h3><a name="SIR_JAMES_THE_ROSE" id="SIR_JAMES_THE_ROSE"></a>SIR JAMES THE ROSE.</h3>


<p>Pinkerton first published this piece in his <i>Scottish
Tragic Ballads</i>, p. 61. In a note, it is said to have
been taken "from a modern edition in one sheet, 12mo.
after the old copy." Motherwell gives another version
"as it occurs in early stall prints," (<i>Minstrelsy</i>, p. 321,)
and suspects a few conjectural emendations in Pinkerton's
text. The passage from v. 51 to v. 59 is apparently
defective, and has, probably, been tampered
with; but Pinkerton's copy is on the whole much
better than Motherwell's, or than Whitelaw's, (<i>Scottish
Ballads</i>, 39,) which professes to be given chiefly from
oral recitations.</p>

<p>Michael Bruce's <i>Sir James the Rose</i> will be found in
another part of this collection. In Caw's <i>Museum</i>
(p. 290) is a ballad in the worst possible taste, styled
<i>Elfrida and Sir James of Perth</i>, which seems to be a
mere disfiguration of Bruce's.</p>

<p>From <i>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</i>, iii. 69. A
single improved reading is adopted from a Newcastle
chap-book.</p>

<p>"Given, in the first edition, from the recitation of a
gentleman, who professed to have forgotten some verses.
These have, in the present edition, been partly restored,
from a copy obtained by the recitation of an
ostler in Carlisle, which has also furnished some slight
alterations."</p>

<p>"The ballad is remarkable, as containing, probably,
the very latest allusion to the institution of brotherhood
in arms, which was held so sacred in the days of
chivalry, and whose origin may be traced up to the
Scythian ancestors of Odin." <span class="smcap">Scott.</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</i>, iii. 94.</p>


<p>This fragment was obtained from recitation in
Ettrick Forest, where it is said to refer to the execution
of Cockburne, of Henderland, a freebooter,
hanged by James V. over the gate of his own tower.
There is another version in Johnson's <i>Museum</i>, (<i>Oh
Ono Chrio</i>, p. 90,) which, Dr. Blacklock informed
Burns, was composed on the massacre of Glencoe.
But in fact, these verses seem to be, as Motherwell has
remarked, only a portion (expanded, indeed,) of <i>The
Famous Flower of Serving Men</i>: see vol. iv. p. 174.</p>

<h3><a name="YOUNG_WATERS" id="YOUNG_WATERS"></a>YOUNG WATERS.</h3>


<p>First published on an octavo sheet, by Lady Jean
Home, about the middle of the last century, and from
this copy reprinted in Percy's <i>Reliques</i>, (ii. 227.)
Buchan has a version (i. 15) twenty-five stanzas
longer than the present, which is given in our Appendix.
This ballad has been supposed to refer to
the fate of the Earl of Murray, (see <i>post</i>, <i>The Bonny
Earl of Murray</i>.) The additional circumstances furnished
by Buchan's copy, however, have led Chambers
to suggest that the unfortunate hero was Walter Stuart,
second son of the Duke of Albany. In support of his
conjecture, he adduces "the name, which may be a
corruption of Walter; the mention of the Heading
(beheading) Hill of Stirling, which is known to have
been the very scene of Walter Stuart's execution; the
relationship which Young Waters claims with the king;
and the sympathy expressed by the people, in the last
verse, for the fate of the young knight, which exactly
tallies with what is told us by the Scottish historians,
regarding the popular feeling expressed in favour of<!-- Page 89 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
the numerous nobles and princes of his own blood,
whom the king saw it necessary to sacrifice." We do
not consider these coincidences sufficient to establish
the historical character of the piece.</p>

<h3><a name="LAMKIN" id="LAMKIN"></a>LAMKIN.</h3>


<p>The following is believed to be a correct account
of the various printed forms of this extremely popular
ballad. In the second edition of Herd's <i>Scottish Songs</i>
(1776) appeared a fragment of eighteen stanzas, called
<i>Lammikin</i>, embellished in a puerile style by some modern
hand. Jamieson published the story in a complete
and authentic shape in his <i>Popular Ballads</i>, in 1806.
Finlay's collection (1808) furnishes us with two more
copies, the first of which (ii. 47) is made up in part of
Herd's fragment, and the second (ii. 57) taken from
a MS. "written by an old lady." Another was given,
from recitation, in Motherwell's <i>Minstrelsy</i>, (1827,)
with the more intelligible title of <i>Lambert Linkin</i>. An
English fragment, called <i>Long Lonkin</i>, taken down
from the recitation of an old woman, is said to have
been inserted by Miss Landon, in the <i>Drawing-Room
Scrap-Book</i>, for 1837. This was republished in Richardson's
<i>Borderer's Table-Book</i>, 1846, vol. viii. 410, and
the editor of that miscellany, who ought to have learned
to be skeptical in such matters, urges the circumstantial
character of local tradition as strong evidence that the
real scene of the cruel history was in Northumberland.<!-- Page 95 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
Lastly, we have to note a version resembling Motherwell's,
styled <i>Bold Rankin</i>, printed in <i>A New Book of
Old Ballads</i>, (p. 73,) and in Whitelaw's <i>Book of Scottish
Ballads</i>, (p. 246,) and an imperfect ballad (<i>Long
Lankyn</i>) in <i>Notes and Queries</i>, New Series, ii. 324.</p>

<p>We have printed Jamieson's, <a href="#LAMBERT_LINKIN">Motherwell's</a>, <a href="#LAMMIKIN_See_p_94">the longer
of Finlay's versions</a>, and <a href="#LONG_LONKIN_See_p_94">the English fragment</a>: the

<h3><a name="LAMBERT_LINKIN" id="LAMBERT_LINKIN"></a>LAMBERT LINKIN.</h3>


<p>"The present copy is given from recitation, and
though it could have received additions, and perhaps
improvements, from another copy, obtained from a
similar source, and of equal authenticity, in his possession,
the Editor did not like to use a liberty which is
liable to much abuse. To some, the present set of the
ballad may be valuable, as handing down both name
and nickname of the revengeful builder of Prime
Castle; for there can be little doubt that the epithet
<i>Linkin</i> Mr. Lambert acquired from the secrecy and
address with which he insinuated himself into that
notable strength. Indeed, all the names of Lammerlinkin,
Lammikin, Lamkin, Lankin, Linkin, Belinkin,
can easily be traced out as abbreviations of Lambert
Linkin. In the present set of the ballad, Lambert
Linkin and Belinkin are used indifferently, as the
measure of the verse may require; in the other recited
copy, to which reference has been made, it is Lammerlinkin
and Lamkin; and the nobleman for whom
he "built a house" is stated to be "Lord Arran." No
allusion, however, is made here to the name of the<!-- Page 101 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
owner of Prime Castle. Antiquaries, peradventure,
may find it as difficult to settle the precise locality of
this fortalice, as they have found it to fix the topography
of Troy." Motherwell's <i>Minstrelsy</i>, p. 291.</p>

<p>In Finlay's second copy, the murderer's name is Balcanqual,
"which," observes the editor, "is an ancient
Scottish surname, and is sometimes corrupted, for the
more agreeable sound, into Beluncan." It is more
likely that Belinkin has suggested Balcanqual, than
that Balcanqual has been corrupted into Lamkin.</p>

<p>Of this affecting ballad different editions have appeared
in Scott's <i>Minstrelsy</i>, Sharpe's <i>Ballad Book</i>, p. 18,
Kinloch's <i>Scottish Ballads</i>, and Motherwell's <i>Minstrelsy</i>.
There is also a fragment in Maidment's <i>North
Countrie Garland</i>, which has been reprinted in Buchan's
<i>Gleanings</i>, p. 164, and a very inferior version,
with a different catastrophe, in Buchan's larger collection,
(ii. 190,) called <i>Warenston and the Duke of
York's Daughter</i>. <a href="#MARY_HAMILTON_Kinloch" title="link to Kinloch's version">Kinloch's copy</a> may be found with
<a href="#MARY_HAMILTON_Maidment" title="link to Maidment's version">Maidment's fragment</a>, in the Appendix to this volume:
<a href="#MARY_HAMILTON" title="link to Motherwell's version">Motherwell's</a> immediately after the present.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott conceives the ballad to have had
its foundation in an event which took place early in
the reign of Mary Stuart, described by Knox as follows:
"In the very time of the General Assembly,
there comes to public knowledge a haynous murther,
committed in the court; yea, not far from the
Queen's lap; for a French woman, that served in the
Queen's chamber, had played the whore with the
Queen's own apothecary. The woman conceived and
bare a childe, whom, with common consent, the father
and mother murthered; yet were the cries of a new<!-- Page 114 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>-borne
childe hearde, searche was made, the childe and
the mother were both apprehended, and so were the
man and the woman condemned to be hanged in the
publicke street of Edinburgh. The punishment was
suitable, because the crime was haynous. But yet was
not the court purged of whores and whoredoms, which
was the fountaine of such enormities: for it was well
known that shame hasted marriage betwixt John Sempill,
called the Dancer, and Mary Levingston, sirnamed
the Lusty. What bruit the Maries, and the
rest of the dancers of the court had, <i>the ballads of that
age</i> doe witnesse, which we for modestie's sake omit.
<span class="smcap">Knox's</span> <i>History of the Reformation</i>, p. 373.</p>

<p>"Such," Sir Walter goes on to say, "seems to be
the subject of the following ballad, as narrated by the
stern apostle of Presbytery. It will readily strike the
reader, that the tale has suffered great alterations, as
handed down by tradition; the French waiting woman
being changed into Mary Hamilton, and the
Queen's apothecary into Henry Darnley. Yet this is
less surprising, when we recollect, that one of the
heaviest of the Queen's complaints against her ill-fated
husband, was his infidelity, and that even with her
personal attendants."</p>

<p>Satisfactorily as the circumstances of Knox's story
may agree with those of the ballads, a coincidence no
less striking, and extending even to the name, is presented
by an incident which occurred at the court of
Peter the Great. "During the reign of the Czar
Peter," observes Mr. C. K. Sharpe, "one of his Empress's
attendants, a Miss Hamilton, was executed for
the murder of a natural child,&mdash;not her first crime in
that way, as was suspected; and the Emperor, whose
admiration of her beauty did not preserve her life,<!-- Page 115 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
stood upon the scaffold till her head was struck off,
which he lifted by the ears and kissed on the lips. I
cannot help thinking that the two stories have been
confused in the ballad; for, if Marie Hamilton was executed
in Scotland, it is not likely that her relations
resided beyond seas; and we have no proof that Hamilton
was really the name of the woman who made
the slip with the Queen's apothecary."</p>

<p>Scott's edition of <i>Mary Hamilton</i>, (the first ever
published,) was made up by him, from various copies.

city of Edinburgh from the suburb, called the Canongate. S.</p>

highest families in Scotland, who were sent to France in her
train, and returned with her to Scotland. Keith gives us
their names, p. 55. "The young Queen, Mary, embarked
at Dunbarton for France, ... and with her went
... and four young virgins, all of the name of
Mary, viz. Livingston, Fleming, Seatoun, and Beatoun."
Neither Mary Livingston, nor Mary Fleming, are mentioned
in the ballad; nor are the Mary Hamilton, and Mary Carmichael,
of the ballad, mentioned by Keith. But if this corps
continued to consist of young virgins, as when originally
raised, it could hardly have subsisted without occasional recruits;
especially if we trust our old bard, and John Knox.</p>

<p>The Queen's Maries are mentioned in many ballads, and
the name seems to have passed into a general denomination
for female attendants.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Scott.</span></p>

<p>"In this set of the ballad, from its direct allusion to
the use of the Savin-tree, a clue is, perhaps, afforded
for tracing how the poor mediciner mentioned by Knox
should be implicated in the crime of Mary Hamilton.
It may also be noted as a feature in this version of the
ballad, which does not occur in any heretofore printed,
the unfortunate heroine's proud and indignant spurning
at life after her character had been tainted by the
infamy of a sentence of condemnation. In another
copy of the ballad, also obtained from recitation, this
sentiment is, perhaps, still more forcibly expressed; at
any rate, it is more appropriate as being addressed to
the King. The whole concluding verses of this copy,
differing as they somewhat do from the version adopted
for a text, it has been thought worth while to preserve.</p>

<h3><a name="BESSIE_BELL_AND_MARY_GRAY" id="BESSIE_BELL_AND_MARY_GRAY"></a>BESSIE BELL AND MARY GRAY.</h3>


<p>From Lyle's <i>Ancient Ballads and Songs</i>, p. 160,
where it was printed as collated "from the singing of
two aged persons, one of them a native of Perthshire."
There are two versions slightly differing from the present;&mdash;one
in Cunningham's <i>Songs of Scotland</i>, iii.
60, obtained from Sir Walter Scott, and another in
Mr. Kirkpatrick Sharpe's <i>Ballad Book</i>, p. 62.</p>

<p>Allan Ramsay wrote a song with the same title, beginning
with the first stanza of the ballad, (<i>Tea Table
Miscellany</i>, i. 70.)</p>

<p>The story of the unfortunate heroines is thus given
by Chambers: "Bessie Bell and Mary Gray were the
daughters of two country gentlemen in the neighborhood
of Perth; and an intimate friendship subsisted
between them. Bessie Bell, daughter of the Laird of
Kinnaird, happening to be on a visit to Mary Gray, at
her father's house of Lynedoch, when the plague of
1666 broke out, to avoid the infection, the two young
ladies built themselves a bower in a very retired and
romantic spot, called the Burn-braes, about three quarters
of a mile westward from Lynedoch House; where
they resided for some time, supplied with food, it is<!-- Page 127 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
said, by a young gentleman of Perth, who was in love
with them both. The disease was unfortunately communicated
to them by their lover, and proved fatal;
when, according to custom in cases of the plague, they
were not buried in the ordinary parochial place of
sepulture, but in a sequestered spot, called the Dronach
Haugh, at the foot of a brae of the same name, upon
the banks of the River Almond."</p>

<h3><a name="THE_CHILDREN_IN_THE_WOOD" id="THE_CHILDREN_IN_THE_WOOD"></a>THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.</h3>


<p><i>The Children in the Wood</i> is perhaps the most popular
of all English ballads. Its merit is attested by the
favor it has enjoyed with so many generations, and
was vindicated to a cold and artificial age by the
kindly pen of Addison. The editor of the <i>Reliques</i>
thought that the subject was taken from an old play,
published in 1601, "of a young child murthered in a
wood by two ruffins, with the consent of his unkle,"
but Ritson discovered that the ballad was entered in
the Stationers' Registers in 1595. The plot of the play
was undoubtedly derived from the Italian, and the
author of the ballad may have taken a hint from the
same source.</p>

<p>Percy's edition, (<i>Reliques</i>, iii. 218,) which we have
adopted, was printed from two old copies, one of them
in black-letter, in the Pepys collection. The full title
is, <i>The Children in the Wood, or, The Norfolk Gentleman's
Last Will and Testament</i>. <i>To the Tune of Rogero</i>,
&amp;c. Copies slightly varying from Percy's may be seen
in <i>A Collection of Old Ballads</i>, (1723,) i. 221; Ritson's
<i>Ancient Songs</i>, ii. 150; <i>The Book of British Ballads</i>,
p. 13; and Moore's <i>Pictorial Book of Ancient Ballad
Poetry</i>, p. 263.<!-- Page 129 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="HUGH_OF_LINCOLN" id="HUGH_OF_LINCOLN"></a>HUGH OF LINCOLN.</h3>


<p>In the year 1255, we are told by Matthew Paris, in
his account of the reign of Henry III., the Jews of
Lincoln stole a boy, named Hugh, of the age of eight
years, whom, after torturing for ten days, they crucified
before a large council of their people, in contempt
of the death of the founder of Christianity. The boy
was sought by his mother in the house of a Jew,
which he had been seen to enter, and his body was
found in a pit. The occupant of the house being
seized, acknowledged the crime, and avowed, besides,
that the like was committed nearly every year by his
nation. Notwithstanding the promise of impunity by
which this confession had been obtained, the wretch
who made it was tied to the tail of a horse and dragged
to the gallows, and after a judicial investigation,
eighteen of the richest and most distinguished Jews
in Lincoln were hanged for participation in the murder,
while many more were detained as prisoners in
the Tower of London. On the other hand, the body
of the child was buried with the honors of a martyr in
Lincoln Cathedral, where a construction, assumed
without reason to be his tomb, is still shown. The
remains of a young person, found near this spot in
1791, were at once taken for granted to be those of<!-- Page 137 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
the sainted infant, and drawings were made of the
relics, which may be seen among the works of the
artist Grimm in the British Museum.</p>

<p>Several stories of the same tenor are reported by
the English chroniclers. It may be doubted whether
there is a grain of truth in any of them, although it
would be no wonder if the atrocious injuries inflicted
on the Jews should, in an instance or two, have provoked
a bloody retaliation, even from that tribe whose
badge has always been sufferance. The annual sacrifice
of a Christian child, in mockery of the crucifixion
of Jesus, is on a par for credibility with the miracles
which are said to have followed the death of those
innocents.</p>

<p>The exquisite tale which Chaucer has put into the
mouth of the Prioress exhibits nearly the same incidents
as the following ballad. The legend of Hugh
of Lincoln was widely famous. Michel has published
an Anglo-Norman ballad, (<i>Hugo de Lincolnia</i>,) on the
subject, which appears to be almost contemporary with
the event recorded by Matthew Paris, and is certainly
of the times of Henry III. The versions of the English
ballad are quite numerous. We give here those
of Percy, Herd, and Jamieson, and two others in
the Appendix. Besides these, fragments have been
printed in Sir Egerton Brydges's <i>Restituta</i>, i. 381,
Halliwell's <i>Ballads and Poems respecting Hugh of
Lincoln</i>, (1849,) and in <i>Notes and Queries</i>, vol. viii.
614, ix. 320, xii. 496. The most complete of all the
versions is to be found in the new edition of the
<i>Musical Museum</i>, vol. iv. p. 500; but that copy is
evidently made up from others previously published.

curious information on the imputed cruelties of the
Jews, Michel's <i>Hugues de Lincoln</i>, and Hume's <i>Sir
Hugh of Lincoln</i>. The whole subject is critically
examined in the <i>London Athenæum</i> for Dec. 15, 1849.</p>

<p>"The text of the following edition has been given
<i>verbatim</i>, as the editor took it down from Mrs. Brown's
recitation; and in it two circumstances are preserved,
which are neither to be found in any of the former
editions, nor in any of the chronicles in which the
transaction is recorded; but which are perfectly in the
character of those times, and tend to enhance the
miracles to which the discovery is attributed. The
first of these is, that, in order that the whole of this
infamous sacrifice might be of a piece, and every possible
outrage shown to Christianity, the Jews threw
the child's body into a well dedicated to the Virgin
Mary; and tradition says, that it was 'through the
might of Our Ladie,' that the dead body was permitted
to speak, and to reveal the horrid story to the disconsolate
mother. The other is, the voluntary ringing of
the bells, &amp;c., at his funeral. The sound of consecrated
bells was supposed to have a powerful effect in
driving away evil spirits, appeasing storms, &amp;c., and
they were believed to be inspired with sentiments and
perceptions which were often manifested in a very
miraculous manner." <span class="smcap">Jamieson's</span> <i>Popular Ballads</i>,

<h3><a name="SIR_PATRICK_SPENCE" id="SIR_PATRICK_SPENCE"></a>SIR PATRICK SPENCE.</h3>

<p class="center">From Percy's <i>Reliques</i>, i. 81.</p>


<p>The event upon which this ballad is founded, if it
has been rightly ascertained, belongs to a remote
period in Scottish history. Margaret, the daughter
of Alexander III., was, in the year 1281, betrothed
to Eric, prince of Norway. The bride was conducted
to her husband by a splendid convoy of knights and
nobles, and in the month of August was crowned
queen. In returning from the celebration of the nuptials,
many of the Scottish escort were lost at sea, and
among those who perished was Sir Patrick Spence, we
are to suppose.</p>

<p>It is in conformity with this view of the origin of
the ballad, (the suggestion of Motherwell,) that in
Buchan's version the object of the voyage is said to be
to take the king's daughter, now "a chosen queen," <i>to</i>
Norway. In Scott's edition, on the other hand, Sir
Patrick is deputed <i>to bring home</i> the king of Norway's
daughter. To explain this circumstance in the story,
Sir Walter is forced to suppose that an unsuccessful
and unrecorded embassy was sent, when the death of
Alexander III. had left the Scottish throne vacant, to
bring the only daughter of Eric and Margaret, styled
by historians the Maid of Norway, to the kingdom of
which, after her grandfather's demise, she became the<!-- Page 148 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
heir. That such an embassy, attended with so disastrous
consequences to the distinguished persons who
would compose it, should be entirely unnoticed by the
chroniclers is, to say the least, exceedingly improbable.</p>

<p>The question concerning the historical basis of the
ballad would naturally lose much of its interest, were
any importance attached to the arguments by which
its genuineness has been lately assailed. These are so
trivial as hardly to admit of a statement. The claims
of the composition to a high antiquity are first disputed,
(<i>Musical Museum</i>, new ed., iv. 457*,) on the ground
that such a piece was never heard of till it was sent to
Percy by some of his correspondents in Scotland, with
other ballads of (assumed) questionable authority.
But even the ballad of <i>Sir Hugh</i> is liable to any impeachment
that can be extracted from these circumstances,
since it was first made known by Percy, and
was transmitted to him from Scotland, (for aught we
know, in suspicious company,) while its story dates also
from the 13th century. Then, "an ingenious friend"
having remarked to Percy that some of the phrases of
<i>Hardyknute</i> seemed to have been borrowed from <i>Sir
Patrick Spence</i> and <i>other</i> old Scottish songs, this observation,
combined with the fact that the localities
of Dunfermline and Aberdour are in the neighborhood
of Sir Henry Wardlaw's estate, leads to a conjecture
that Lady Wardlaw may have been the author of <i>Sir
Patrick Spence</i>, as she is known to have been of
<i>Hardyknute</i>. It could never be deemed fair to argue
from those resemblances which give plausibility to a
counterfeit to the spuriousness of the original, but
in fact there is <i>no</i> resemblance in the two pieces.
<i>Hardyknute</i> is recognized at once by an ordinary critic<!-- Page 149 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
to be a modern production, and is, notwithstanding
the praise it has received, a tame and tiresome one
besides. <i>Sir Patrick Spence</i>, on the other hand, if not
ancient, has been always accepted as such by the most
skilful judges, and is a solitary instance of a successful
imitation, in manner and spirit, of the best specimens
of authentic minstrelsy.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>It is not denied that this ballad has suffered, like
others, by corruption and interpolations, and it is not,
therefore, maintained that hats and cork-heeld shoon
are of the 13th century.</p>

<p>We have assigned to Percy's copy the first place,
because its brevity and directness give it a peculiar
vigor. <a href="#SIR_PATRICK_SPENS">Scott's edition follows</a>, made up from two MS.
copies, (one of which has been printed in Jamieson's

not mentioned in history; but I am able to state that tradition
has preserved it. In the little island of Papa Stronsay,
one of the Orcadian group, lying over against Norway, there
is a large grave or tumulus, which has been known to the inhabitants,
from time immemorial, as 'The grave of Sir Patrick
Spens.' The Scottish ballads were not early current in
Orkney, a Scandinavian country; so it is very unlikely that
the poem could have originated the name. The people know
nothing beyond the traditional appellation of the spot, and
they have no legend to tell." Aytoun, <i>Ballads of Scotland</i>, i.

to the antiquity of the legend of Sir Patrick Spens,&mdash;supposing
the matter of fact to be well established, and the

<h3><a name="KING_ESTMERE" id="KING_ESTMERE"></a>KING ESTMERE.</h3>

<p class="center">From <i>Reliques of English Poetry</i>, i. 65.</p>


<p>"This romantic legend," says Percy, "is given from
two copies, one of them in the Editor's folio MS., but
which contained very great variations." This second
copy has been conjectured to be of Percy's own
making, the ballad never having been heard of by any
one else, out of his manuscript. Judging from the
internal evidence, the alterations made in the printed
text were not very serious.</p>

<p>King Easter and King Wester have appeared in the
ballad of <i>Fause Foodrage</i>, (vol. iii. p. 40.) In another
version of the same, they are called the Eastmure king
and the Westmure king, (Motherwell's <i>Minstrelsy</i>, p.
lix.) There is also a tale cited in the <i>Complaynt of
Scotland</i>, (i. 98,) of a king of Estmureland that married
the daughter of the king of Westmureland. This
is plausibly supposed by Ritson to have been a romance
of Horn, in which case the two countries should mean
England and Ireland. King Esmer is one of King
Diderik's champions (in the Danish ballad, <i>Kong Diderik
og hans Kæmper</i>), and the father of Svend Vonved
(in <i>Svend Vonved</i>). In the Flemish and German
romances of <i>The Knight of the Swan</i>, Essmer, or Esmerés,
is one of the seven sons of Oriant, and in <i>Le
Dit de Flourence de Romme</i> (Jubinal, <i>Nouveau Recueil
de Contes</i>, etc., i. 88), Esmère is a Roman prince.
(Grundtvig, i. 78, 236.) For the nonce, we are told<!-- Page 160 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
that King Estmere was an English prince, and we may,
perhaps, infer from the eighth stanza that King Adland's
dominions were on the same island. But no
subject of inquiry can be more idle than the geography
of the romances.</p>

<p>The rings so often used in ballads to conciliate the porter
would seem to be not personal ornaments, but coins. For an
account of Ring Money, see the paper of Sir William Betham,
in the seventeenth volume of the <i>Transactions of the Royal
Irish Academy</i>.</p>

<h3><a name="SIR_CAULINE" id="SIR_CAULINE"></a>SIR CAULINE.</h3>

<p class="center">From <i>Reliques of English Poetry</i>, i. 44.</p>


<p>"This old romantic tale," says Percy, "was preserved
in the Editor's folio MS., but in so very defective
and mutilated a condition, (not from any chasm in
the MS., but from great omission in the transcript,
probably copied from the faulty recitation of some illiterate
minstrel,) that it was necessary to supply several
stanzas in the first part, and still more in the second,
to connect and complete the story."</p>

<p>Many of the interpolations acknowledged in such
general terms might with some confidence be pointed
out. Among them are certainly most, if not all, of the
last twelve stanzas of the Second Part, which include
the catastrophe to the story. It is difficult to believe
that this charming romance had so tragic and so sentimental
a conclusion.</p>

<p>The first part of this ballad is preserved in Scotland,
under the title of <i>King Malcolm and Sir Colvin</i>, and
is printed in our Appendix from Buchan's collection.
In this, Sir Colvin weds the princess after his victory
over the Elrick knight.<!-- Page 174 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

chivalry. In old romances no incident is of more frequent
occurrence than this, of knights already distinguished
for feats of arms laying aside their wonted cognizances, and,
under the semblance of stranger knights, manfully performing
right worshipful and valiant deeds. How often is the
renowned Arthur, in such exhibitions, obliged to exclaim,
"O Jhesu, what knight is that arrayed all in grene (or as
the case may be)? he justeth myghtily!" The Emperor
of Almaine, in like manner, after the timely succor afforded

<h3><a name="FAIR_ANNIE" id="FAIR_ANNIE"></a>FAIR ANNIE.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</i>, iii. 252.</p>


<p>The story of <i>Fair Annie</i> is widely disseminated.
The substance of it is found in the beautiful romance
of Marie de France, the <i>Lai le Frein</i>, of which an
ancient English translation is printed in Weber's
<i>Metrical Romances</i>, i. 357. The Swedish and Danish
ballads go under the same name of <i>Fair Anna</i>, and
may be seen in Arwidsson's <i>Svenska Fornsånger</i>, i.
291; Geijer's <i>Svenska Folk-Visor</i>, i. 24; and Nyerup's
<i>Danske Viser</i>, iv. 59. Jamieson has rendered the
Danish ballad very skilfully, in the Scottish dialect,
from Syv's edition of the <i>Kæmpe Viser</i>. In Dutch,
the characters are Maid Adelhaid and King Alewijn
(Hoffmann's <i>Holländische Volkslieder</i>, 164.) The story
as we have found it in German is considerably changed.
See <i>Die wiedergefundene Königstochter</i>, in <i>Des Knaben
Wunderhorn</i>, ii. 274, and <i>Südeli</i>, Uhland's <i>Volkslieder</i>,
i. 273.</p>

<p>The Scottish versions of <i>Fair Annie</i> are quite
numerous. A fragment of eight stanzas was published
in Herd's collection, (<i>Wha will bake my bridal
bread</i>, ed. 1776, i. 167.) Sir Walter Scott gave a<!-- Page 192 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
complete copy, from recitation in the <i>Minstrelsy of
the Scottish Border</i>. Two other copies, also from oral
tradition, were inserted by Jamieson in the Appendix
to his <i>Popular Ballads</i>, (<i>Lady Jane</i>, ii. 371, <i>Burd
Helen</i>, ii. 376,) and from these he constructed the
edition of <i>Lady Jane</i>, printed at p. 73 of the same
volume. Motherwell (<i>Minstrelsy</i>) affords still another
variety, and Chambers has compiled a ballad from
all these sources and a manuscript furnished by Mr.
Kinloch, (<i>Scottish Ballads</i>, p. 186.)</p>

<p>In this collection we have adopted the versions of
Scott and <a href="#FAIR_ANNIE_2">Motherwell</a>, giving Jamieson's translation
of <i>Skj&oelig;n Anna</i> <a href="#SKIOEN_ANNA_FAIR_ANNIE_See_p_191">in our Appendix</a>.</p>

<p>First published by Percy from his folio MS., <i>Reliques</i>,
iii. 94. Several traditionary versions have since
been printed, of which we give <i><a href="#BURD_ELLEN">Burd Ellen</a></i> from Jamieson's,
and in the Appendix, <i><a href="#LADY_MARGARET_See_p_205">Lady Margaret</a></i> from
Kinloch's collection. Jamieson also furnishes a fragment,
and Buchan, (<i>Ballads of the North of Scotland</i>,
ii. 30,) a complete copy of another version of <i>Burd
Ellen</i>, and Chambers (<i>Scottish Ballads</i>, 193,) makes
up an edition from all the copies, which we mention
here because he has taken some lines from a manuscript
supplied by Mr. Kinloch.</p>

<p>As has been remarked (vol. ii. p. 114), <i>Erlinton</i> retains an
important, and even fundamental trait of the older forms of
the story, which is not found in any other of the English versions
of the <i>Douglas Tragedy</i>. It was a northern superstition
that to call a man by name while he was engaged in fight
was a fatal omen, and hence a phrase, "to name-to-death."
To avert this danger, Ribolt, in nearly all the Scandinavian
ballads, entreats Guldborg not to <i>pronounce his name</i>, even if
she sees him bleeding or struck down. In her agony at seeing
the last of her brothers about to be slain, Guldborg forgets
her lover's injunction, calls on him by name to stop, and
thus brings about the catastrophe. Ignorant reciters have
either dropped the corresponding passage in the English ballad,
or (as in this case) have so corrupted it, that its significance
is only to be made out by comparison with the ancient
copies.</p>

<p>"From a fragment in the Editor's folio MS., which,
though extremely defective and mutilated, appeared
to have so much merit, that it excited a strong desire
to attempt the completion of the story. The reader
will easily discover the supplemental stanzas by their
inferiority, and at the same time be inclined to pardon
it, when he considers how difficult it must be to imitate
the affecting simplicity and artless beauties of the
original." <span class="smcap">Percy</span>, <i>Reliques</i>, i. 113. (See vol. ii. p. 114.)</p>

<p>It must be acknowledged that this truly modest
apology was not altogether uncalled for. So extensive
are Percy's alterations and additions, that the
reader will have no slight difficulty in detecting the
few traces that are left of the genuine composition.
Nevertheless, Sir Walter Scott avers that the corrections
are "in the true style of Gothic embellishment!"</p>

<h3><a name="SIR_ALDINGAR" id="SIR_ALDINGAR"></a>SIR ALDINGAR.</h3>


<p>Of this very remarkable ballad two copies have
been printed in English, <i>Sir Aldingar</i>, from the Percy
MS. (<i>Reliques</i>, ii. 53), "with conjectural emendations
and the insertion of some additional stanzas," and <i><a href="#SIR_HUGH_LE_BLOND">Sir
Hugh Le Blond</a></i>, by Scott, from recitation. The corresponding
Danish ballad, <i>Ravengaard og Memering</i>,
first published by Grundtvig, is extant in not less than
five copies, the oldest derived from a MS. of the middle
of the 16th century, the others from recent recitations.
With these Grundtvig has given an Icelandic
version, from a MS. of the 17th century, another in
the dialect of the Faroe Islands, and a third half Danish,
half Faroish, both as still sung by the people.
The ballad was also preserved, not long ago, in Norway.&mdash;<i>Danmarks
Gamle Folkeviser</i>, i. 177-213, ii.
640-645.</p>

<p>All these ballads contain a story one and the same
in the essential features&mdash;a story which occurs repeatedly
in connection with historical personages,
in Germany, France, Italy, and Spain, as well as
England,&mdash;and which has also furnished the theme
for various modern romances, poems, and tragedies.<!-- Page 235 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
The connection of the different forms of the legend has
been investigated by the Danish editor at considerable
length and with signal ability; and we shall endeavor
to present the principal results of his wide research in
the few pages which our narrow limits allow us to give
to such questions.</p>

<p>The names of the characters in the Danish ballads
are Henry (called Duke of Brunswick and of Schleswig
in the oldest), Gunild (of Spires, called also Gunder),
Ravengaard, and Memering. To these correspond,
in the English story, King Henry, Queen
Eleanor, Sir Aldingar (the resemblance of this name
to Ravengaard will be noted), and a boy, to whom no
name is assigned. Eleanor, it hardly need be remarked,
is a queen's name somewhat freely used in ballads (see
vol. vi. 209, and vol. vii. 291), and it is possible that the
consort of Henry II. is here intended, though her reputation
both in history and in song hardly favors that
supposition.</p>

<p>The occurrence of Spires in the old Danish ballad
would naturally induce us to look for the origin of the
story in the annals of the German emperors of the
Franconian line, who held their court at Spires, and
are most of them buried in the cathedral at that place.
A very promising clue is immediately found in the history
of King (afterwards Emperor) Henry III., son of
the Emperor Conrad II. Salicus. This Henry was
married, in the year 1036, to Gunhild, daughter of
Canute the Great. An English chronicler, William
of Malmesbury, writing in the first half of the 12th
century, tells us that after this princess had lived many
years in honorable wedlock, she was accused of adultery.
Being forced to clear herself by wager of battle,<!-- Page 236 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
she found in all her retinue no one who was willing to
risk a combat with her accuser, a man of gigantic stature,
save a little boy whom she had brought with her
from England. The issue of the duel established her
innocence,&mdash;her diminutive champion succeeding by
some miracle in ham-stringing his huge adversary;
but it is alleged that the queen refused to return to
her husband, and passed the rest of a long life in a
monastery.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>A Norman-French <i>Life of Edward the Confessor</i>,
written about 1250, repeats this story, and adds the
champion's name.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A daughter had the king,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">She remained not long with him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because by felons, who had no reason<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To blame her calumniously,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She was charged with shame:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the Emperor was she accused.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">According to the custom of the empire,<!-- Page 237 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">It behoved her to clear herself from shame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By battle; and she takes much trouble<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To find one to be her champion:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But finds no one, for very huge was<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The accuser,&mdash;as a giant.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Undertook the fight with him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the first blow he hamstrung him;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the second he cut off his feet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mimecan was the dwarf's name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who was so good a champion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the history, which is written,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Says of him. The lady was freed from blame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the lady the emperor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more will have as her lord."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Finally, John Brompton, writing two hundred
years after William of Malmesbury, repeats his account,
and gives the names of <i>both</i> the combatants,&mdash;"a
youth called Mimicon, and a man of gigantic
size, by name Roddyngar" (Raadengard = the Danish
Ravengaard).</p>

<p>The story of William of Malmesbury and the rest,
though it is sufficiently in accordance with the Danish
and English ballads, is in direct opposition to the
testimony of contemporary German chroniclers, who
represent Queen Gunhild as living on the best terms
with her husband, and instead of growing old in God's
service in a nunnery, as dying of the plague in Italy
two years after her marriage, and hardly twenty years
of age. It is manifest, therefore, that the English
chroniclers derived their accounts from ballads current
at their day,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> which, as they were not founded on any<!-- Page 238 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
real passages in the life of Gunhild, require us to look
a little further for their origin.</p>

<p>The empress Gunhild was called by the German
chroniclers of her day by various names&mdash;as Cunihild,
Chunihild, Chunelind, and <i>Cunigund</i>, which last
name she is said to have assumed at her coronation.
This change of Gunhild's name accounts for the unfounded
scandals which were in circulation about her
in her native land, scarcely a hundred years after her
death. Cunigund, wife of Henry III., was in fact confounded
with a contemporary German queen and
empress, <i>St. Cunigund</i>, widow of the Emperor Henry
II. This mistake, which has been made more than
once, will be acknowledged to be a very natural one
(especially for foreigners), when it is considered that
both queens not only bore the same name, but were
married each to an emperor of the same name (Henry),
both of whom again were sons of Conrads.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Referring now to the history of St. Cunigund, we
read in the papal bull of Innocent III., by which she
was canonized in the year 1200, that "she consecrated<!-- Page 239 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
her virginity to the Lord, and preserved it intact,&mdash;so
that when at one time by the instigation of the enemy
of mankind a suspicion had been raised against
her, she, to prove her innocence, walked with bare
feet over burning ploughshares, and came off unscathed."
Again, we read in a slightly more recent
German chronicle, as follows: "The Devil, who hates
all the righteous, and is ever seeking to bring them to
shame, stirred up the Emperor against his wife, persuading
him, through a certain duke, that in contempt
of her husband she had committed adultery with another
man. The empress offered to undergo an
ordeal, and a great many bishops came to see it carried out.
Whereupon seven glowing ploughshares were
laid on the ground, over which the empress was forced
to walk in bare feet, to attest her innocence, ...
which, when the king saw, he prostrated himself before
her with all his nobles." Adalbert's Life of St.
Henry (which is, at the latest, of the 12th century),
agreeing in all essentials with these accounts, adds an
important particular, explaining how it was that the
Devil brought the queen's honor into question, namely,
that he was seen by many to go in and out of her
private chamber, in the likeness of a handsome young
man.&mdash;St. Cunigund is said to have undergone the
ordeal at Bamberg, in the year 1017. The story,
however, is without foundation, not being mentioned
by any contemporary writers, but first appearing in
various legends, towards the year 1200.</p>

<p>But St. Cunigund is by no means the first German
empress of whom the story under consideration is told.
A writer contemporary with her, who has nothing to
say about the miracle just recounted, relates some<!-- Page 240 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>thing
very similar of <i>another</i> empress, one hundred
and thirty years earlier, namely, of Richardis, wife of
Charles III. The tale runs that this Charles, in the
year 887, accused his queen of unlawful connection
with a Bishop. Her Majesty offered to subject herself
to the Judgment of God, either by duel or by the
ordeal of burning ploughshares. It is not said that
either test was applied, but only that the queen retired
into a cloister which she had herself founded. This is
the contemporary account. A century and a half later
we are told that an ordeal by <i>water</i> was actually undergone,
which again is changed by later writers into
an ordeal by <i>fire</i>,&mdash;the empress passing through the
flames in a waxed garment, without receiving the least
harm; in memory of which, a day was kept, five centuries
after, in honor of St. Richardis, in the monastery
to which she withdrew.</p>

<p>Several other similar cases might be mentioned, but
it will suffice to refer to only one more, more ancient
than any of those already cited. Paulus Diaconus
(who wrote about the year 800) relates that a Lombard
queen, Gundiberg (of the 7th century), having
been charged with infidelity, one of her servants asked
permission of the king to fight in the lists for his mistress's
honor, and conquered his antagonist in the
presence of all the people. The same story is told,
more in detail, by Aimoin, a somewhat more recent
writer, of another Gundeberg, likewise of the 7th century.
A Lombard nobleman makes insolent proposals
to his queen, and meets with a most emphatic repulse.
Upon this he goes to the king with a story that the
queen has been three days conspiring to poison her
husband, and put her accomplice in his place. The<!-- Page 241 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
tale is believed, and the queen shut up in prison.
The Frankish king, a relation of the injured woman,
remonstrates on the injustice of condemnation without
trial, and the king consents to submit the question to
a duel. The champion of innocence is victorious, and
the real criminal is condignly punished. This form of
the legend, the oldest of all that have been cited,
approaches very near to the Danish and English ballads.</p>

<p>Our conclusion would therefore be, with Grundtvig,
that the ballads of <i>Sir Aldingar</i>, <i>Ravengaard and
Memering</i>, and the rest, are of common derivation
with the legends of St. Cunigund, Gundeberg, &amp;c.,
and that all these are offshoots of a story which, "beginning
far back in the infancy of the Gothic race and
their poetry, is continually turning up, now here and
now there, without having a proper home in any definite
time or assignable place." Many circumstances
corroborative of this view might be added, but we
must content ourselves with obviating a possible objection.
An invariable feature in the story is the <i>judicium
Dei</i> by which the innocence of the accused wife is
established, but there is much difference in the various
forms of the legend as to the <i>kind</i> of ordeal employed,
and some minds may here find difficulty. A close
observation, however, will show such a connection
between the different accounts as to prove an original
unity. Even the earlier legends of St. Cunigund do
not agree on this point; one makes her to have walked
over burning ploughshares, another to have carried red-hot
iron in her hands. The Icelandic copy of the
ballad has both of these: the queen "carries iron and
walks on steel"; and there is also a "judgment by<!-- Page 242 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
iron bands." All these three tests are found in the
Faroe ballad, which brings in Memering besides, and
thus furnishes a transition to the Danish, which says
nothing about the trial by fire, and has only the duel.
Finally the English ballad completes the circle with
the pile at which the queen was to be burned, in case
she should not be able to prove her innocence by the
duel.</p>

<p>At a time uncertain, but earlier than the 14th century,
this legend was transplanted into the literature
of Southern Europe. It is found in various Spanish
chronicles, the earliest the <i>Historia de Cataluña</i> of
Bernardo Desclot, written about 1300; also in a Provençal
and a French chronicle of the 17th century.
In most of these the part of the queen's champion is
assigned to the well-known Raimund Berengar, Count
of Barcelona, who, in the year 1113, took Majorca
from the Moors. The popularity of the story is further
proved by the Spanish romance, <i>El Conde de
Barcelona y la Emperatriz de Alemania</i>; the French
romance <i>L'Histoire de Palanus, Comte de Lyon</i>; and
a novel of Bandello, the 44th of the Second Part.
This last was re-written and published in 1713, with
slight changes, as an original tale, by M<sup>me</sup> de Fontaines
(<i>Histoire de la Comtesse de Savoie</i>), whence Voltaire
borrowed materials for two of his tragedies, <i>Tancrède</i>
and <i>Artémire</i>.</p>

<p>By the circuitous route of Spain the story returns
to England in a romance of the 15th century, <i>The
Erle of Tolous</i> (Ritson, <i>Metr. Rom.</i> iii. p. 93).
Nearly related with this romance is the German story-book
(derived from the French) on which Hans Sachs
founded his tragedy, <i>Der Ritter Golmi mit der Herzo<!-- Page 243 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>gin
auss Britanien</i>. Another German popular story-book,
<i>Hirlanda</i>, exhibits a close resemblance to our
ballad of <i>Sir Aldingar</i>.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>"This old fabulous legend is given from the editor's
folio MS., with conjectural emendations, and the insertion
of some additional stanzas to supply and complete
the story. It has been suggested to the editor that the
author of the poem seems to have had in his eye the
story of Gunhilda, who is sometimes called Eleanor (?),
and was married to the emperor (here called king)
Henry."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Percy.</span></p>


<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> "Although there are seven centuries between William
and our times," says Grundtvig, "and the North Sea
between Jutland and the land of his birth, it almost seems
as if he had taken his account from the very ballad which
is at this day sung on the little island of Fuur in the Lym
Fiord."</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> We have substituted this paragraph instead of a later
chronicle cited by Grundtvig. The translation is that of
the English editor: <i>Lives of Edward the Confessor</i> (p. 39,
193), recently published by authority of the British government.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> William of Malmesbury refers to ballads which were
made on the splendid nuptial procession, by which Gunhild
was conducted to the ship that was to bear her to her husband,
as still sung about the streets in his time.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> An argument in confirmation of what is here said is
afforded by a German annalist of the 14th century, who
states, under the date 1038, that the empress Cunigund died
the 3d of March, and was buried at Spires. Now St. Cunigund
actually did die the 3d of March, and that day is dedicated
to her in the Roman calendar, but the year was 1040,
and she was buried at Bamberg, while Gunhild died in                1038
(July 18), and was buried in the monastery of Limburg,
near Spires.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> In § v. of his Introduction to <i>Ravengaard og Memering</i>,
Grundtvig seeks to show that this ballad, though independent
in its origin, was at one time, like many others, woven
into the great South-Gothic epic of Diderik of Bern, and
then, having divided the legend into two portions,&mdash;the Accusation
and its Cause, the Vindication and its Mode,&mdash;he, in
§ vi. vii. traces out with wonderful learning and penetration
the extensive ramifications of the first part, taken by itself,
through the romance of the Middle Ages. The whole essay
is beyond praise.</p></div>

<h3><a name="SIR_HUGH_LE_BLOND" id="SIR_HUGH_LE_BLOND"></a>SIR HUGH LE BLOND.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</i>, iii. 51.</p>


<p>"The tradition, upon which the ballad is founded, is
universally current in the Mearns; and the Editor is
informed, that, till very lately, the sword, with which
Sir Hugh le Blond was believed to have defended the
life and honour of the Queen, was carefully preserved
by his descendants, the Viscounts of Arbuthnot. That
Sir Hugh of Arbuthnot lived in the thirteenth century,
is proved by his having, 1282, bestowed the patronage
of the church of Garvoch upon the Monks of Aberbrothwick,
for the safety of his soul.&mdash;<i>Register of Aberbrothwick,
quoted by Crawford in Peerage.</i></p>

<p>"I was favoured with the following copy of <i>Sir Hugh
le Blond</i>, by K. Williamson Burnet, Esq. of Monboddo,
who wrote it down from the recitation of an old woman,<!-- Page 254 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
long in the service of the Arbuthnot family. Of course,
the diction is very much humbled, and it has, in all
probability, undergone many corruptions; but its antiquity
is indubitable, and the story, though indifferently
told, is in itself interesting. It is believed that there
have been many more verses." <span class="smcap">Scott.</span></p>

<h3><a name="THE_KNIGHT_AND_SHEPHERDS_DAUGHTER" id="THE_KNIGHT_AND_SHEPHERDS_DAUGHTER"></a>THE KNIGHT, AND SHEPHERD'S DAUGHTER.</h3>


<p>"This ballad (given from an old black-letter copy,
with some corrections) was popular in the time of
Queen Elizabeth, being usually printed with her picture
before it, as Hearne informs us in his preface to
Gul. Neubrig, <i>Hist. Oxon</i>, 1719, 8vo. vol. i. p. lxx.
It is quoted in Fletcher's comedy of the <i>Pilgrim</i>, act
4, sc. 2." <span class="smcap">Percy's</span> <i>Reliques</i>, iii. 114.</p>

<p>The Scottish ballad corresponding to Percy's has
been printed by Kinloch, p. 25. Besides this, however,
there are three other Scottish versions, superior
to the English in every respect, and much longer.
They are <i>Earl Richard</i>, Motherwell, p. 377; (also in
Buchan's <i>Ballads of the North of Scotland</i>, ii. 81;) a
ballad with the same title in Kinloch's collection, p. 15;
and <i>Earl Lithgow</i>, Buchan, ii. 91. In all these, the
futile attempts of the knight to escape marrying the
lady, and the devices by which she aggravates his
reluctance to enter into the match, are managed with
no little humour. We give <a href="#EARL_RICHARD_B">Motherwell's edition</a> a place
next to Percy's, and refer the reader for Kinloch's <a href="#EARL_RICHARD_B_See_p_260">to
the Appendix</a>.<!-- Page 261 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p>v. <a name="Linenote_IV_8a_26" id="Linenote_IV_8a_26"></a><a href="#LNanchor_IV_8a_26" title="link to line number">26</a>. This simile resembles a passage in a MS. translation
of an Irish Fairy tale, called <i>The Adventures of Faravla,
Princess of Scotland, and Carral O'Daly, Son of Donogho More
O'Daly, Chief Bard of Ireland</i>. "Faravla, as she entered her
bower, cast her looks upon the earth, which was tinged with
the blood of a bird which a raven had newly killed: 'Like
that snow,' said Faravla, 'was the complexion of my beloved,
his cheeks like the sanguine traces thereon; whilst the raven
recalls to my memory the colour of his beautiful locks.'"
There is also some resemblance in the conduct of the story,
betwixt the ballad and the tale just quoted. The Princess
Faravla, being desperately in love with Carral O'Daly, despatches
in search of him a faithful confidante, who, by her
magical art, transforms herself into a hawk, and, perching
upon the windows of the bard, conveys to him information
of the distress of the Princess of Scotland. <span class="smcap">Scott.</span></p>

towards Leith,) was murdered, on the 2d of July, 1600,
by a man named Robert Weir, who was employed to
do so by his wife, Jean Livingstone, daughter of the
Laird of Dunipace. The unfortunate woman, who
thus became implicated in a crime so revolting to humanity,
was only twenty-one years of age at the time.
It is probable from some circumstances, that her husband
was considerably older than herself, and also that
their marriage was any thing but one of love. It is
only alleged, however, that she was instigated to seek
his death by resentment for some bad treatment on his
part, and, in particular, for a bite which he had inflicted
on her arm. There was something extraordinary
in the deliberation with which this wretched woman
approached the awful gulf of crime. Having resolved
on the means to be employed in the murder, she sent
for a quondam servant of her father, Robert Weir,
who lived in the neighbouring city. He came to the
place of Waristoun, to see her; but, for some unexplained
reason was not admitted. She again sent for
him, and he again went. Again he was not admitted.<!-- Page 317 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
At length, on his being called a third time, he was
introduced to her presence. Before this time she had
found an accomplice in the nurse of her child. It was
then arranged, that Weir should be concealed in a
cellar till the dead of night, when he should come forth
and proceed to destroy the laird as he lay in his chamber.
The bloody tragedy was acted precisely in accordance
with this plan. Weir was brought up, at
midnight, from the cellar to the hall by the lady herself,
and afterwards went forward alone to the laird's
bedroom. As he proceeded to his bloody work, she
retired to her bed, to wait the intelligence of her husband's
murder. When Weir entered the chamber,
Waristoun awoke with the noise, and leant inquiringly
over the side of the bed. The murderer then leapt
upon him; the unhappy man uttered a great cry;
Weir gave him several dreadful blows on vital parts,
particularly one on the flank vein. But as the laird
was still able to cry out, he at length saw fit to take
more effective measures: he seized him by the throat
with both hands, and compressing that part with all
his force, succeeded, after a few minutes, in depriving
him of life. When the lady heard her husband's first
death-shout, she leapt out of bed, in an agony of mingled
horror and repentance, and descended to the hall:
but she made no effort to countermand her mission of
destruction. She waited patiently till Weir came
down to inform her that all was over.</p>

<p>"Weir made an immediate escape from justice; but
Lady Waristoun and the nurse were apprehended before
the deed was half a day old. Being caught, as
the Scottish law terms it, <i>red-hand</i>,&mdash;that is, while
still bearing unequivocal marks of guilt, they were<!-- Page 318 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
immediately tried by the magistrates of Edinburgh,
and sentenced to be strangled and burnt at a stake.
The lady's father, the Laird of Dunipace, was a favourite
of King James VI., and he made all the interest
he could with his majesty to procure a pardon; but
all that could be obtained from the king, was an order
that the unhappy lady should be executed by decapitation,
and that at such an early hour in the morning
as to make the affair as little of a spectacle as possible.</p>

<p>"The space intervening between her sentence and
her execution was only thirty-seven hours; yet, in
that little time, Lady Waristoun contrived to become
converted from a blood-stained and unrelenting murderess
into a perfect saint on earth. One of the then
ministers of Edinburgh has left an account of her conversion,
which was lately published, and would be extremely
amusing, were it not for the disgust which
seizes the mind on beholding such an instance of perverted
religion. She went to the scaffold with a demeanour
which would have graced a martyr. Her
lips were incessant in the utterance of pious exclamations.
She professed herself confident of everlasting
happiness. She even grudged every moment which
she spent in this world, as so much taken from that
sum of eternal felicity which she was to enjoy in the
next. The people who came to witness the last scene,
instead of having their minds inspired with salutary
horror for her crime, were engrossed in admiration of
her saintly behaviour, and greedily gathered up every
devout word which fell from her tongue. It would
almost appear from the narrative of the clergyman,
that her fate was rather a matter of envy than of any
other feeling. Her execution took place at four in<!-- Page 319 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
the morning of the 5th of July, at the Watergate, near
Holyroodhouse; and at the same hour her nurse was
burnt on the castle-hill. It is some gratification to
know, that the actual murderer, Weir, was eventually
seized and executed, though not till four years after."</p>

<p class="center">From Percy's <i>Reliques</i>, iii. 316.</p>


<p>The three following pieces are here inserted merely
as specimens of a class of tales, horrible in their incidents
but feeble in their execution, of which whole
dreary volumes were printed and read about two centuries
ago. They were all of them, probably, founded
on Italian novels.</p>

<p>"The subject of this ballad is taken from a folio
collection of tragical stories, entitled, <i>The Theatre of
God's Judgments, by Dr. Beard and Dr. Taylor</i>, 1642.
Pt. 2, p. 89. The text is given (with corrections)
from two copies; one of them in black-letter in the
Pepys Collection. In this every stanza is accompanied
with the following distich by way of burden:</p>

research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
